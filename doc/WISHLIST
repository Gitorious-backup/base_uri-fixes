- set up an Admin profile - superuser installed by default
- set up an Admin interface - manage users, daemon status
- make it more configurable (logo, basic color theme at least)
- make it private (enforce login instead of being always open)
  - maybe not mix public and private but an option to choose between them
- i18n/l10n
- Watcher's List/Favorite projects
- Feature to Delete (actually Hide) a repository
- async task to compile lists/rss
  - newest projects
  - projects with more activity
  - forking history visualization (graphical)

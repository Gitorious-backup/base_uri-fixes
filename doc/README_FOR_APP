== Gitorious

Gitorious.org -- Free open source hosting with a twist!

== How to deploy (for local development)

1. Do the normal rails app stuff (database.yml etc.)
2. Fix the config/gitorious.sample.yml, and rename it to gitorious.yml.
3. If you want real project data, find a project, set the 'ready' status to true, create a bare git repository (git --bare init) in the directory GitoriousConfig['repository_base_path']/#{project.slug}/#{repository.name}.git, and push something to that repository (cd to a git repository with commits and do "git push path/to/the/bare/repository/you/just/created master").
4. There is no.. 4!

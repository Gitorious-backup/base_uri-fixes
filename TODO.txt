a ProjectMirror that sucks in svn repositories. They need to be differentiated form normal projects (don't display owner etc, since it's a mirror). Also, the mainline repository should probably be immutable so people can commit changes to the actual mirror.

Groups may be a better alternative to allowing multiple repositories in a project, so a Group (or Product?) has many projects.

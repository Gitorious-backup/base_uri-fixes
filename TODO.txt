(in no particular order)

* Get rid of the non-libre google graphs in favor of locally-generated ones (though NOT by the rails app)
* Make the fact that you _can_ clone/fork any repo more visible, maybe reword it since people confuse it with local cloning
* Update the HACKING with some basic coding guidelines
* Show the most recent mergerequests on users dashboard so they can track them
* Make the archive download an external little mongrel/rack thing, and store the result per sha1
* Comments on MergeRequests and/or votes (or just comments when you resolve)
* only load scriptacolous+friends when needed
* git-blame rendering?
* Reword /about page
* mail the user when someone adds him as a comitter
* expire fragment caches for project+repos on deletion
* view complete raw diff (.diff respond_to ?)
*a Tone down the "owner" of a repository, or implement a proper "mirror" project type.
*b be able to mark a project as a "mirror"
* reset password functionality
* Nicer diff stats
* more interesting project stats on frontpage
* parse git submodule data and link to project if submodule is in gitorious
* link to users in gitorious in commmits if email match
* add mainline as a remote branch in clones
* timezone support
* Email source_repository owner about merge_request changes
* Get rid of all the mocking in the controller tests, or at least clean it up
* Nag project owners with no commits to the mainline repos after a week or two
* gitk-style branch view
* Projects can add multiple "pages", not just the index description
* paginate comments
* OpenID login
* Clean up in commit diff CSS
* graph Repository#parent relationships properly
* (A RemoteRepository class for repositories hosted elsewhere?)
* Auto-remove cloned repositories that havent been committed to after 7 days?
* Refactor the Task/queue system
* A "Status" field for a project (though a wiki-frontpage makes this unneeded-ish)
* improve commenting and comments visibility
* handle mising/wrong SHA1s gracefully in browser
* parse SHA1s in commits+comments
* Normalize url fields (eg add http:// if it aint there) on User+Project
* Detect renames etc when showing a commit
* Always add a "mainline-upstream" branch that track the mainline repos automagically to clones

a ProjectMirror that sucks in svn repositories. They need to be differentiated form normal projects (don't display owner etc, since it's a mirror). Also, the mainline repository should probably be immutable so people can commit changes to the actual mirror.

Groups may be a better alternative to allowing multiple repositories in a project, so a Group (or Product?) has many projects.

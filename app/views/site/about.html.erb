  <a name="about"></a><h1>About Gitorious</h1>

  <p><strong><a href="/p/gitorious">Gitorious</a> aims to provide a great way of doing distributed opensource 
    code collaboration</strong></p>
  
  <h2>The idea</h2>
  <p>Traditional code- and project forges offer many great things and has without 
    a question helped developers of open source software. However, there's always 
    the issue of long-term maintainability; as humans we always get distracted, 
    busy and or just plain tired of working with things in the long run.</p>
  
  <p>Distributed version control provides a way around this by making everyones 
    copy a full repository, so if people like someone elses stuff better, or 
    that someone else is actively maintaining the project they can just pull from 
    that person instead of the "official" repository. And if the project 
    maintainer decides to, he can pull those changes into his mainline branch. 
    That's what makes open source great.</p>
  
  <p><strong><a href="/p/gitorious">Gitorious</a></strong> provides a 
    way of keeping track of these clones easily by:</p>
  
  <ul class="bullet_list">
  	<li>Seeing what they're doing</li>
  	<li>Knowing where they can be found</li>
  	<li>Allowing anyone to contribute without being blessed with "commit bits"</li>
  	<li>Making it easier for maintainers to accept contributions</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Gitorious still under development and there's many many more things I'd like 
    to do with it. If you have ideas for improvements or technical issues please 
    do stop by the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gitorious">discussion group</a>.</p>

  <h3>I get "fatal: no matching remote head" when trying to clone a repository</h3>
  <p>
    Most likely the repository you're trying to clone is empty, and the error 
    message is git's friendly way of telling you that. See below (or by clicking 
    "more info" next to repositorys "push url") for info on how t push to it.
  </p>

  <h3>How do I point my local Git repository at Gitorious?</h3>
  <p>
    Easiest way is to put something like the following in your <code>.git/config</code> 
    file of the repository you wish to push:
  <pre>
  [remote "origin"]
         url = git@gitorious.org:<em>project</em>/<em>repository.git</em>
         fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
  [branch "master"]
         remote = origin
         merge = refs/heads/master
  </pre>
    and then <code>git push origin master</code> to push the code to Gitorious.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also just run "<code>git push git@gitorious.org:tumbline/mainline.git</code>", or 
    you can setup a remote by doing the following (add --fetch to the add call to 
    get the config from above):
    <pre>
    git remote add origin git@gitorious.org:<em>project</em>/<em>repository.git</em>
    # to push the master branch to the origin remote we added above:
    git push origin master 
    # after that you can just do:
    git push
    </pre>
  </p>

  <h3>Why is my email displayed?</h3>
  <p>
    The email you used to signup with Gitorious is displayed to other users, so that they 
    can contact you about your projects if they need to. We do however take light 
    measures against crawlers by not displaying your email in completely plain text. <br />
    But just to be clear: we won't sell or use any information you give to 
    gitorious.org against you or anyone else for financial and/or personal gains.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h3>Why do I need to upload my public SSH key?</h3>
  <p>
    When you push to a Git repository, your public key is how we authenticate 
    you and if have the permissions required to do a commit to a given repository

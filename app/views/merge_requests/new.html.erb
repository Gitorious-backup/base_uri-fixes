    <p>
      By sending a merge request to another repository you're inviting the owners
      of that repository to merge the changes you have in your clone. When writing
      a short summary explaining your overall changes the recipients can decide
      whether to merge your commits or provide feedback on them. The merge requests
      are public so that everyone can provide feedback on your changes.

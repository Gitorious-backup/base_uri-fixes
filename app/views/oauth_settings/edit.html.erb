<h1>Edit contribution settings</h1>
<p>
  This page lets you specify settings for the OAuth site used for signing off merge requests. If you enable this feature, you will need to provide at least the <strong>site</strong>, <strong>signoff key</strong> and <strong>signoff secret</strong> options. For non-standard paths, also supply the <strong>path prefix</strong> option. In the column to the right you will find the current options used.<br/>
  Leave the site field empty to deactivate the requirement of merge requests to be signed off.

describe UsersHelper do
  it "should encode email" do
    message = %{
      mail_to_encoded passes :replace_at and :replace_dot
      values to mail_to (a rails helper), which should
      obfuscate the email address, but it apparently does
      NOT do that if :encode => 'javascript'
      
      Need to investigate if this is a Rails bug and
      either fix it there or let go of obfuscation.

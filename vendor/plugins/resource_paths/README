ResourcePaths
=============

Creates "shortcut" path names for resource names in the URI.


Example
=======

ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
	map.resources :trajectories, :path_name => "t"
end

would map the uri "/t/666/"to the TrajectoriesController, and still be maintaining the original rails helper methods such as "trajectory_url", "trajectory_id" (if nested) and so on.
